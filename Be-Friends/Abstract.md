# Why Can't We Be Friends - Abstract

React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with JavaScript. However, developing Android apps requires more effort.  This talk will look at the ways in which my team and I learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a React Native app for Android, as well as my experience as a JavaScript developer being thrust into the native world.  

This talk will review common reasons why many companies return to native development for Android, and in particular AirBnB's detail reasons for sunsetting React Native, to find specific pain points in the React Native for Android development process. Using my team's retrospective on our React Native project, I will provide examples of our solutions and suggestions for how to proceed on a new React Native android project.

In particular, I will discuss our use of the react native device detection package to work through our Android style audits and ways we have worked around react native's shortcomings.
