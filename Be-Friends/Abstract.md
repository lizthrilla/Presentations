# Why Can't We Be Friends - Abstract

React Native is advertised as a framework for developing native apps with javascript. However, developing Android apps requires more effort.  This talk will look at the ways in which my team and I learned, sometimes the hard way, how to develop a react native app for Android, as well as my experience as a JavaScript developer being thrust into the native world.  

In particular, I will discuss our use of the react native device detection package to work through our Android style audits and ways we have worked around react native's shortcomings.
