# Abstract

We talk about accessibility, but how many developers are actually working to make apps and sites accessible? Sadly, not nearly enough. Accessibility is something every developer should be working towards, but many find the information overwhelming and, ironically, inaccessibile. With this presentation, Liz will demystify web and mobile accessibility, while also empowering developers to make their projects accessible immediately. This presentation is language and framework agnostic, and takes a holistic look as to why accessibility should be something that concerns every single developer. In this session, you will learn why accessibility is your responsibility, that making your project accessible is much easier than you anticipate, and, most importantly, how not to get sued.*

*Liz is not a lawyer, this is not legally binding advice.

## Summary

A non-legally binding look at web accessibility, why you should care, and what you can do to improve your site's accessibility. This talk will look at some recent legal cases, the WCAG, the 2018 WCAG updates, as well as how web accessibility influences mobile accessibility.

## Target Audience

All Developers regardless of experience, language or framework.
